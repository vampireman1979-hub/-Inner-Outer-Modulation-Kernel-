# -Inner-Outer-Modulation-Kernel-
Inner–Outer Modulation Kernel:   A five‑qubit architecture using an anchor‑driven entanglement backbone and two‑layer modulation to propagate transformations from inner to outer qubits. Thermodynamically scaled rotations, echo loops, and symmetry‑breaking steps create a controlled, interpretable evolution for hybrid quantum‑classical models.
